For our project we built a unit converter with some commonly needed functionalities. It can convert between C and F for temperatures, a bunch of distance units, a bunch of weight and mass units, the ten most used currencies in the world, and between a few different number bases. Our currency section pulls conversion rates from an API to calculate the conversions, the rest utilize fixed conversion equations.
